## Creatures

Not the most thorough solution (or tests) with pretty basic logic - but hopefully it gives you a rough idea of how I approach the problem and the way I structure code.

I'm not going to do any documentation here, as I'm hoping that the code and set-up would be quite self-explanatory. If not, it means I need to be clearer and I'm happy to discuss. :)
